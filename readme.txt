Set of codes that are designed to find Brillouin frequency and its amplitude from picosecond acoustics (PA)/ultrasonics data. The program has been designed such that it should also detect any other modes in the PA signal. So, the code can also be used to find surface acoustic and bulk modes that are seen in your PA signal. The code does only focus on the mode with the largest amplitude though, but it displays the entire Fourier spectrum, so you can inspect the spectrum to your specification. 
I have uploaded two versions, one in jupyter and the other in spyder. The spyder version comes with a bulk data processing code, the jupyter one explains things to more detail. The actual process is identical for the two versions.
